#GDX Autumn MVC example: GdxIdle
This is a sample idle game built with Autumn MVC running on LibGDX. It was made with an early Autumn version, and I never forced myself to look into it and correct the lazy coding or use the newest features. Even though there are some newer examples, I'm still leaving this - someone might still find this useful.

I really didn't want to focus on the logic, so the gameplay is very simple (and so are the graphics). Some parts of the code (logic-related especially) could be refactored, but my goal was to show you the basics. Seeing that it took me about 500 lines of Java code and 100 lines in LML templates, I think it's not so bad, considering we get asset management, music and sounds, preferences management, smooth screen transitions, i18n (2 languages), data-driven logic (OK, that one goes to LibGDX JSON support) and so on. There are only a few comments - if I ever get a request to put some comments on any class, I will most likely do so.

Feel free to ask any questions.
